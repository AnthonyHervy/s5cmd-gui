Plan:

1. App Name: TauriS3Browser

2. App Structure:

   - `src/main.tsx`: The main file that renders the whole React application. It initializes Chonky with drag-and-drop, sets up the bucket and secrets configuration tools, and manages the state of selected buckets and secrets.

   - `src/components/S3Browser.tsx`: This component implements the S3 browser using the Chonky library. It exports a S3Browser component that takes the selected bucket and secret as props and displays the contents of the bucket. It uses the `useFiles` and `useFolderChain` hooks from Chonky to handle file browsing. It also handles Chonky actions such as `ChonkyActions.Delete` and `ChonkyActions.Move`.

   - `src/components/BucketConfig.tsx`: This component provides a UI for the user to select and configure the S3 bucket. It exports a BucketConfig component that takes a function to update the selected bucket as a prop. It uses the `s5cmd ls` command to list available buckets.

   - `src/components/SecretConfig.tsx`: This component provides a UI for the user to select and configure the S3 secrets. It exports a SecretConfig component that takes a function to update the selected secret as a prop. It stores secrets in LocalStorage.

   - `src/tauri/api.ts`: This file contains functions for calling the Tauri backend API. It exports functions `runS5cmd`, `removeS3Object`, `moveS3Object`, and `copyS3Objects`.

   - `src/tauri/src/main.rs`: This file defines the Tauri backend. It exports a `run_s5cmd` command that runs `s5cmd` commands.

3. Data Schemas:

   - `Bucket`: An object with a `name` property.

   - `Secret`: An object with `accessKeyId` and `secretAccessKey` properties.

4. DOM Element IDs:

   - `bucket-select`: A select box for selecting a bucket in the BucketConfig component.

   - `secret-select`: A select box for selecting a secret in the SecretConfig component.

   - `s3-browser`: The div containing the S3Browser component.

5. Message Names:

   - `updateBucket`: A message sent from the BucketConfig component to the main app to update the selected bucket.

   - `updateSecret`: A message sent from the SecretConfig component to the main app to update the selected secret.

6. Function Names:

   - `updateBucket`: A function in the main app that updates the selected bucket.

   - `updateSecret`: A function in the main app that updates the selected secret.

   - `runS5cmd`: A function in the Tauri API that runs `s5cmd` commands.

   - `removeS3Object`: A function in the Tauri API that removes an S3 object using `s5cmd rm`.

   - `moveS3Object`: A function in the Tauri API that moves an S3 object using `s5cmd mv`.

   - `copyS3Objects`: A function in the Tauri API that copies S3 objects using `s5cmd run`.
